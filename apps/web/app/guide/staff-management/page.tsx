            What staffing an FFXIV venue involves
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            A venue staff team is a volunteer group. No one gets a salary, attendance is not legally required, and people have lives outside the game. The challenge is building enough structure that shifts get covered and payouts feel fair, without making it feel like a job no one applied for.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Most venues run with three to eight staff across a mix of roles: hosts who greet patrons and keep conversation moving, servers who handle drinks and tips, and managers who coordinate the shift. Larger venues add security, entertainers, and event staff on top of that core.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            The coordination layer grows faster than the roster does. Two staff on a shift is a group chat. Eight staff across three shifts per week is a scheduling, payroll, and communication problem. The tools that handled two people do not scale to eight.

            Building your roster
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Start with fewer staff than you think you need. Two reliable people per shift beat four unreliable ones. Adding staff as the venue grows is easy; replacing people who ghost after two weeks costs more time than hiring slowly.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Define roles before you post hiring notices. A host and a server are different jobs with different expectations. Write down what each role does, when they are expected on shift, and how tips get split. New hires who understand the structure from day one cause fewer problems than those who discover it after a dispute.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Hiring from your regular patron base works well. People who already like the venue are more likely to show up and understand how it runs. Cold hires from server recruitment channels can work, but expect a higher drop-off rate in the first few weeks.
          </p>

            Scheduling and running shifts
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Post the schedule at least three days before the week starts. Staff who find out about a shift the morning of cannot adjust plans. Three days is enough lead time for most people to flag conflicts without setting the schedule a fortnight in advance.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Require explicit confirmations. A staff member who does not respond to a shift assignment is not confirmed. Treat no reply the same as a no: find cover. Chasing confirmations the night before a shift is avoidable if you set the expectation early that silence means unassigned.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Keep one backup for each shift who can step in if someone drops. They do not need to be on standby, just aware they are the backup and willing. Agree on it before the shift, not during.

            Payroll and tip splits
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Decide on a tip split policy before your first paid shift, not after your first dispute. Common approaches: tips go to the staff member who earned them, tips pool across the shift and split equally, or tips pool weighted by hours worked. Any approach works. Ambiguity and mid-run policy changes are what cause disputes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Log tips as they happen, not from memory at the end of the night. A server who earns 50,000 gil across a three-hour shift in ten separate transactions will not remember the exact number an hour later. Real-time logging takes seconds per transaction and makes payroll accurate without anyone arguing over figures.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Pay out on a consistent schedule. Weekly works for most venues. Staff who know they will be paid every Sunday do not chase you on Monday morning. No defined schedule means questions you do not need.
