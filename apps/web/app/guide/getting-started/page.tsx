            What is an FFXIV roleplay venue?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            A venue in Final Fantasy XIV is a player-run establishment hosted inside a private estate, Free Company house, or apartment. Bars, clubs, lounges, inns, shops: any roleplay space with regular open hours and a staff team counts. Venues open on a schedule, hire staff, run events, and serve as social hubs for the RP community on their world.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Each venue is tied to a specific world and data centre. Your patron reach is shaped by which data centre you sit on (Chaos, Light, Crystal, Aether), because players can only visit venues on worlds within their own data centre without transferring.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Venues are player-organised. There is no in-game tool for scheduling shifts, tracking sales, or telling patrons you are open. Most owners start with Discord and a spreadsheet. That works until it does not.

            You will spend more time on the operational side than you expect. Decorating and hosting are straightforward. Coordinating staff, scheduling events, and tracking revenue across multiple open nights is where new owners lose hours.

            Small venues manage with a spreadsheet and a couple of Discord channels. Add five or more staff, a regular event schedule, and patrons who expect consistency, and the spreadsheet stops working.

          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            The coordination layer is what grows fastest: who is rostered when, what happened to last week's tips, whether the Partake listing matches the actual schedule.
