            The discovery problem
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            There are hundreds of active venues across the FFXIV community. A patron deciding where to spend their evening has no in-game venue browser, no official list, no notification system. They check the places they already know, ask in their FC chat, or search community spaces.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            If your venue is not in those places with accurate information, patrons looking for somewhere to go tonight have no way to find you. FFXIV promotion is about being findable when someone is already looking.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Being listed in the community directories, posting on Partake when you have events, and keeping your open status current are the three actions that bring in patrons you have not met yet.

            <a href="https://ffxivvenues.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[var(--xiv-blue)] hover:underline">FFXIV Venues</a> is the main community-run directory for player venues. Patrons searching for a bar, lounge, or roleplay space on a specific world start here. If your venue is not listed, you are missing the most consistent passive discovery channel the community has.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            List your venue with complete information: world, ward, plot, a short description, and your schedule. Patrons skip incomplete listings. A patron who cannot tell at a glance when you are open and where you are moves to the next result.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Keep the listing current. When your schedule changes, update the directory. A stale listing that sends someone to a closed venue costs you more than no listing at all.

            Partake: event listings and discovery
          </h2>

            <a href="https://partake.gg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[var(--xiv-blue)] hover:underline">Partake.gg</a> is where the FFXIV community browses upcoming events. If you are running a theme night, competition, anniversary, or anything with a fixed date and concept, it belongs on Partake. Patrons who never open their usual Discord servers check Partake when they want something to do.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Post far enough in advance to appear in searches before the date. For a patron who has never heard of your venue, the event title and description carry the entire pitch.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Events belong on Partake. Regular opens do not need listings there. A themed night with a Partake listing and a Discord announcement will pull more patrons than the same event with only a Discord post, because it reaches people outside your existing audience.
          </p>

            Discord: where your regulars live
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Your venue Discord is where regulars stay connected between visits. Keep an announcements channel with open night posts and event notices. Patrons who care about your venue will have notifications on for that channel. Do not make them search through general chat to find out when you are open next.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Beyond your own server, community Discord servers for your data centre often have venue-advertisement or event channels. Post there when you have events. These channels reach patrons outside your existing community who are already looking for somewhere to go.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Keep posts short. Venue ad channels move fast. A clean post with your venue name, date, time in Server Time, and world/ward beats a wall of text that patrons scroll past.

            In-game shouts: immediate reach
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Shout chat reaches everyone in your current zone. Used in residential areas and populated hubs, a shout pulls in patrons who are already logged in and looking for something to do. You are open right now, here is where you are.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Keep shouts brief. Venue name, type, ward and plot, and a reason to come tonight. A generic "we are open, come visit" loses to a shout that gives patrons a specific reason to show up.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Shout on your home world and, when you have reason to travel, from the aetheryte plaza or residential hubs on other worlds in your data centre. Cross-world foot traffic is real. Some of your best regulars will be from other worlds who found you from a shout on a random evening.

            Consistency beats volume
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            A venue that posts in three places every time it opens, for months, builds a following. One promotion campaign followed by silence does not. Patrons come back to venues they see regularly, not venues they spotted once.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Your open status needs to be accurate when you are open, your directory listing needs to match your current schedule, and your Discord needs a post when doors go up. None of these tasks is large on its own. Together, without a system, they slip.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Venues with reliable foot traffic are the ones patrons can count on: same nights, same hours, and a listing that confirms it before they make the trip.
