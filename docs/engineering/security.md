## Threat model

Solo-built B2C app for a niche gaming community. The realistic adversaries:

| Adversary | Capability | What they want |
|---|---|---|
| **Scraper / bot** | High-volume HTTP traffic, no logged-in account | Public venue data, any unauthenticated info |
| **Malicious user** | Has a valid account, has an API key, knows their `userId` | Other venues' data, other users' API keys, role escalation |
| **Disgruntled ex-staff** | Was a venue member, got removed | Continued read access to venue data |
| **Key thief** | Obtained a plugin API key (logged accidentally, leaked in chat) | Make calls as the victim |

What's *not* a serious adversary for this app:
- Nation-state attackers (no high-value data)
- Sophisticated SQL injection (Prisma ORM, parameterized everything)
- XSS injection at scale (no user-rendered HTML, no comments, no rich text)

This shapes which findings get fixed urgently and which can defer.

## Audit findings

A line-by-line review six months in produced **18 findings**: 4 Critical, 6 High, 7 Medium, 5 Low. Below is the full list with status as of 2026-04-26.

### Critical (4 of 4 fixed)

| ID | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | Plugin API keys stored as plaintext in DB | ✅ Fixed: `keyHash` column, SHA-256 lookup, raw key shown once at creation. Migration handled gracefully so existing plugin users didn't get logged out mid-session. |
| C2 | Secrets baked into `docker-compose.yml` (literal values) | ✅ Fixed: `env_file: .env` + `${VAR}` interpolation |
| C3 | Same as C2 for cron container | ✅ Fixed alongside C2 |
| C4 | `Dockerfile` had `COPY .env .env` baking secrets into image layers | ✅ Fixed: removed; `.env` is mounted at runtime, never built in |

### High (6 of 6 fixed)

| ID | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|
| H1 | No rate limiting anywhere | ✅ Fixed: ioredis-backed sliding window on plugin + dashboard routes |
| H2 | Auth endpoints unrestricted | ✅ Fixed: `signin`/`callback` paths throttled to 10/min/IP, polled paths exempt |
| H3 | Hardcoded fallback API key for the homepage stats endpoint | ✅ Fixed: now requires `HOMEPAGE_API_KEY` env var; no fallback. Verified history search: literal key was never committed. |
| H4 | IDOR in feedback GET (any auth'd user could read any feedback by ID) | ✅ Fixed: query scoped to `session.user.id` |
| H5 | Venue queries didn't filter by `Membership.status: "active"`, so revoked staff retained read access | ✅ Fixed: 40 queries across 20 routes patched |
| H6 | Cron endpoints leaked `String(error)` to response body, exposing internal error shape | ✅ Fixed: removed; debug auth logging also stripped |

### Medium (most fixed, two deferred with reason)

| ID | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|
| M1 | No rate limit on auth flow | ✅ Fixed (see H2) |
| M2 | Manager could self-promote to OWNER via PATCH | ✅ Fixed: role escalation check looks at `role`, `temporaryRole`, `permanentRole` |
| M3 | `withAuthAndRateLimit` dead code | ✅ Removed |
| M4 | CSP allows `unsafe-eval` and `unsafe-inline` | ⏸ Deferred. Threat model is low-risk for this app (no user-rendered HTML, no comments/uploads, OAuth-only auth). Strict CSP would require nonce-based setup + click-through testing of every page. Trigger to revisit: any feature that renders user-supplied HTML, or an XSS finding in dependencies. |
| M5 | Invite token GET requires no auth, leaks venue name | ❌ Dismissed: intentional UX. Anyone joining will see the venue name regardless. Not a real leak. |
| M6 | Database password is weak (`venue_db_pass_2026`) | ⏸ Deferred. Internal docker network only, not externally exposed. Trigger to rotate: any future external DB exposure, or any container breach. |
| M7 | SSH password auth enabled | ✅ Fixed: ed25519 keys only, password auth disabled in `sshd_config.d/10-disable-password.conf` |

### Low (most fixed)

| ID | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | No `npm audit` in CI | ✅ Fixed: `.github/workflows/security.yml` runs `npm audit --audit-level=high` on push/PR + weekly cron |
| L2 | NextAuth `debug` mode fell back to `NODE_ENV` check, untrusted in containers | ✅ Fixed: now requires explicit `NEXTAUTH_DEBUG=true` |
| L3 | `new PrismaClient()` instantiated in 4 plugin routes (connection leak risk under concurrency) | ✅ Fixed: shared singleton in `lib/prisma.ts` |
| L4 | Stray `.bak` files containing schema in repo | ✅ Fixed: moved to `~/backups/`, cleaned from working tree |
| L5 | Verbose error responses in some non-cron routes | ✅ Fixed alongside H6 sweep |

## Two illustrative fixes

### The keyhash migration

C1 was non-trivial because the fix could have logged out every active plugin user. Naive approach: add `keyHash` column, change `validateApiKey` to look up by hash, deploy. Existing keys have `NULL keyHash` → no lookups match → all plugin traffic dies until users regenerate keys (which they can't, because the plugin can't sign in to do it).

The actual roll-out:
1. Add nullable `keyHash` column
2. Backfill: hash every existing key, write to its `keyHash` column
3. Deploy `validateApiKey` to look up by `keyHash` (not `key`)
4. Soak window: monitor `lastUsedAt` to confirm all active keys are still working
5. Drop the `key` column (still pending; deferred low-risk cleanup)

The seam between steps 2 and 3 is the only window where a race could hurt: a request arriving between hash-write and code-deploy would still go through the old plaintext path. The sequence ordering eliminates that window.

### The plugin RL ordering bug (post-audit)

The audit said "rate limiting is fixed." Then a follow-up test exposed an ordering bug: the rate limit check ran *after* `validateApiKey()`. So bad/missing keys returned 401 before any counter incremented, leaving the keyspace open to unthrottled brute-force probing. Each probe still cost a database lookup (lookup-by-hash), so this was both a security bug and a DoS vector.

```
Before fix:                  After fix:
1. validate key              1. enforcePluginIpRateLimit  ← per-IP, 60/min
2. enforcePluginRateLimit    2. validate key
3. handler                   3. enforcePluginRateLimit    ← per-key, 120/min
                             4. handler
```

Verified with an 80-request burst from a single IP using `x-forwarded-for: 10.20.30.40`:
```
60 401   (no key sent, IP counter incrementing)
20 429   (IP cap hit)
```

Two layers run on every authenticated request: the IP throttle catches credential stuffing, the per-key throttle catches a compromised legitimate key. Per-IP comes first specifically because it can short-circuit before any DB work.

## Security infrastructure summary

| Layer | Implementation | File |
|---|---|---|
| **Plugin auth** | `vm_<nanoid>` keys, SHA-256 hashed at rest | `lib/api/plugin-auth.ts` |
| **Plugin rate limit** | Per-IP (60/min) + per-key (120/min read, 60/min write) | `lib/api/plugin-rate-limit.ts` |
| **Browser auth** | NextAuth + Discord OAuth, JWT sessions | `lib/auth.ts` |
| **OAuth flow throttle** | 10/min/IP on `signin`/`callback`, exempt polled paths | `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` |
| **Web route rate limit** | Per-IP, per-route budgets | `lib/middleware/with-rate-limit.ts` |
| **Cron auth** | Constant-time Bearer token comparison | `lib/cron-auth.ts` |
| **Permission model** | Membership-based with role + status check | `lib/permissions.ts` |
| **Headers** | `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, HSTS | `next.config.ts` |
| **Build-time scan** | `npm audit --audit-level=high` in CI | `.github/workflows/security.yml` |

## What I learned

1. **Audits are checklists; verification is sequential reasoning.** "Rate limiting exists" passed the checklist. "Rate limiting runs before the expensive operation it's protecting" did not. Test the *invariant*, not the *presence*.
2. **Document deferrals with their re-trigger.** Every `⏸ Deferred` line above has a "trigger to revisit" condition. Without it, deferrals quietly become permanent.
3. **Threat model first, then prioritize.** Strict CSP is "best practice." For an app with no user-rendered HTML, it's premature. The same hour of work could close higher-likelihood holes elsewhere.
4. **Some findings are not real findings.** M5 (invite token leaks venue name) was dismissed because anyone joining the venue sees the name anyway. Auditors find what's there; humans decide what matters.
