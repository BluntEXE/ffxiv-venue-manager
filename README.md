## Overview

XIV Venue Manager is a modern, full-featured platform designed specifically for FFXIV roleplaying venue owners and staff. Manage multiple venues, coordinate events, track staff, handle sales, assign tasks, and automate Discord notifications, all from one powerful dashboard.

The platform is two parts: a **web dashboard** (this repo) and a **Dalamud game-client plugin** that captures in-game patron events and shifts in real time, syncing them to the dashboard for analytics and payroll.

### Key Benefits

- **Mobile-First Design**: Fully responsive on all devices

## Quick Start

See [QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md) for detailed setup instructions.
